# Why I Love Bun

I switched from Node.js to [Bun](https://bun.sh) about a year ago and I haven't looked back. It's fast, it's batteries-included, and the developer experience is simply better.

## It's stupid fast

Package installs that used to take 30 seconds with npm take under 5 with Bun. Cold starts are near-instant. If you're running scripts or lightweight servers, the difference is night and day.

## One tool for everything

Bun is a runtime, package manager, bundler, and test runner all in one. You don't need to configure webpack, jest, or a separate package manager. Just `bun run`, `bun test`, `bun add` — that's the whole mental model.

## Hono pairs perfectly with it

I've been using [Hono](https://hono.dev) as my web framework of choice when building APIs with Bun. It's lightweight, typed, and has great middleware support. The combo of Bun + Hono feels like what Express should have been.

```typescript
import { Hono } from "hono";

const app = new Hono();

app.get("/", (c) => c.text("Hello from Bun!"));

export default app;
```

## Should you switch?

If you're building new projects, absolutely try Bun. It's production-ready and the ecosystem support keeps getting better. The only caveat is some native Node.js modules that rely on C++ bindings — check compatibility first if that's a concern.

But for the vast majority of web projects? Bun is the move.
