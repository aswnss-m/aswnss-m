# Hello World

Hey there! I'm Aswin — a software developer who goes by **@aswnss** online.

I've been building things on the web for a while now, and I figured it's about time I started writing about it. This blog is going to be a mix of things I'm learning, projects I'm working on, and occasional thoughts about tech and life.

## What to expect

Mostly I'll be writing about:

- **Next.js and React** — the stack I use the most
- **Bun and Hono** — incredibly fast runtime and framework combo I've been loving
- **Frappe** — enterprise open-source framework I work with
- **React Native (Expo)** — building cross-platform mobile apps

## Soft Served Web

I co-founded [Soft Served Web](https://www.softservedweb.com) where we help clients build AI-powered web apps, Shopify stores, and rapid MVPs. If you have a project in mind, feel free to reach out at [aswin@softservedweb.com](mailto:aswin@softservedweb.com).

Looking forward to writing more. See you in the next one.
